## `👨‍💻` ABOUT ME
Hi, my name is João Vitor, I'm 20 years old, I'm studying software engineering, and I've always had contact with technology, when I was 16 I started studying programming and identified with the area, since then I've been studying and updating on new technologies and how I can improve what I've done previously, discovering new design patterns and systems architecture

## `🚀` EXPERIENCE
I currently have 2 years of professional experience with development, my main technologies being Java and Spring Framework, in addition I also know about databases, having worked with PostgreSQL and Oracle (not as a DBA)
I also have knowledge of Docker and Kafka, which were technologies that I needed to use during my journey
